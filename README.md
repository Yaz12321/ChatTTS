# ChatTTS
A Streamlabs Chatbot script that allows a viewer to use TTS



Errors are logged on a text file in the script folder, and will appear under 'information' in the script tab on Chatbot. If the script is not running, check the ErrorLog.txt file. If you could not solve the issue, delete the ErrorLog.txt file, run the script. If a new ErrorLog.txt file is created, contact me and attach the log file.
