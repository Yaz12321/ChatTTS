# ChatTTS
A Streamlabs Chatbot script that allows a viewer to use TTS

This is an early version of the script. You need to run TTSrun.py manually (and keep the window open, but minimised) for the TTS to work.

Future versions will fix this.


To change the rate and volume of speech: 
1- right click on TTSrun.py

2- Choose Edit with IDLE

3- adjust the values of speak.Rate and speak.Volume

4- Save, run the file, and close IDLE when you finish editing.
